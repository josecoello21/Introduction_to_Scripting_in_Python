# Strings Quiz

**NOTE:** 
- The functions for questions 6 and 7 can be executed in [CodeSkulptor3/Strings_Quiz](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user307_MYVcul3A4d_1.py/)

- The functions for the Practice Exercises for Lists can be executed in [CodeSkulptor3/Practice_Exercises](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user307_My0kRGcvLI_1.py/)

1. Which of the expressions below select the last character in the string "Grail"?

**Answer:**

- `"Grail"[-1]`

- `"Grail"[4]`

2. Which of the string slices below selects the string "Anthrax" from the string "Castle Anthrax"?

**Answer:**

- `"Castle Anthrax"[7  :]`

- `"Castle Anthrax"[7  : 15]`

3. Which one of the operators below can not be used with strings in Python?

**Answer:** `- (subtraction)`

4. What does the expression a_str.find(sub) do when the string sub is not a substring of the string a_str?

**Answer:** Return the value -1.

5. Which of the string format expressions below return the string "abracadabra"?

**Answer:**

- `"{2}{1}{0}".format("abra", "cad", "abra")`

- `"{0}{1}{0}".format("abra", "cad")`

6. Write a function count_vowels(word) that takes the string word as input and returns the number of occurrences of lowercase vowels (i.e. the lowercase letters "aeiou") in word. **Hint:** Python has a built-in string method that can count the number of occurrences of a letter in a string.

After you have implemented count_vowels, run the following two statements:

```{python}
print(count_vowels("aaassseefffgggiiijjjoOOkkkuuuu"))
print(count_vowels("aovvouOucvicIIOveeOIclOeuvvauouuvciOIsle"))
```

The first statement should print **13** in the console. Enter the second number printed in the console in the box below.

```{python}
def count_vowels(str):
    vowels = str.count('a') + str.count('e') + str.count('i') + str.count('o') + str.count('u')
    return vowels

print(count_vowels("aaassseefffgggiiijjjoOOkkkuuuu"))
print(count_vowels("aovvouOucvicIIOveeOIclOeuvvauouuvciOIsle"))
```

        13
        17

**Answer:** 17

7. Write a function demystify(l1_string) that takes a string composed of the characters "l" and "1" and returns the string formed by replacing each instance of "l" by "a" and each instance of "1" by "b".

Once you have implemented demystify, test your function with calls below.

```{python}
print(demystify("lll111l1l1l1111lll"))
print(demystify("111l1l11l11lll1lll1lll11111ll11l1ll1l111"))
```

The first call should print the string "aaabbbabababbbbaaa" in the console.  Enter the second string printed in the console in the text box below. Do not include enclosing quotes.

```{python}
def demystify(l1_string):
    first = l1_string.replace("l", "a")
    second = first.replace("1", "b")
    return second
    
print(demystify("lll111l1l1l1111lll"))
print(demystify("111l1l11l11lll1lll1lll11111ll11l1ll1l111"))
```

        aaabbbabababbbbaaa
        bbbababbabbaaabaaabaaabbbbbaabbabaababbb

**Answer:** bbbababbabbaaabaaabaaabbbbbaabbabaababbb
